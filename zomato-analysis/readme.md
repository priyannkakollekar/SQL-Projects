# ðŸ“Š Zomato SQL Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project dives into Zomato's dataset to analyze customer behaviors, membership-driven sales, and product trends. Using SQL, I aimed to provide actionable insights that can support business decisions, improve customer engagement, and optimize product offerings on the Zomato platform.

## Objectives

1. Understand **customer behavior** based on membership data.<br/>
2. Identify **top-performing products** and **high-frequency users**.<br/>
3. Explore  **sales trends ** and  **points earned ** by users.<br/>

## Dataset

The analysis was conducted on Zomatoâ€™s customer dataset, which includes information about:<br/>

**Sales Data:** Information on products, transactions, and customer membership.<br/>
**Customer Information:** Details on customer interactions and membership levels.<br/>
**Product Data:** Popular products and associated customer points.<br/>

## SQL Skills Applied

**Data Retrieval:** SELECT statements for data extraction.<br/>
**Join Operations:** INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and multiple joins for data integration across tables.<br/>
**Data Aggregation:** GROUP BY for customer and product-level analysis, along with COUNT and SUM to aggregate key metrics.<br/>
**Filtering:** Applied WHERE to focus on specific segments.<br/>
**Ordering and Ranking:** Used ORDER BY, RANK, and PARTITION BY to rank popular products and customers.<br/>
**Window Functions:** Leveraged RANK() for deeper insights into product popularity.<br/>

## Key Insights

**Product Popularity:** Products like Product 1 and Product 3 emerged as top-performing, with Product 3 earning the highest customer points (3045).<br/>
**Customer Engagement:** Membership analysis highlighted that users who frequently engage with Zomato have higher loyalty points, especially for high-ranked products.<br/>
**Sales Trend:** The data shows upward sales trends for certain products, especially among active members, which Zomato could leverage for future promotions.<br/>

## Recommendations

**Customer Loyalty:** Boost loyalty programs for high-performing products.<br/>
**Sales Strategy:** Prioritize promotions around popular products and target top members.<br/>
**Membership Enhancements:** Optimize Zomato points to drive more engagement across other products.<br/>

## Repository Structure

**SQL Queries:** A breakdown of SQL queries used for analysis.<br/>
**Data Visualizations:** Graphs and charts that illustrate key trends and insights.<br/>
**Documentation:** Detailed explanations of each query and methodology.<br/>

## Project Reflection

This project has not only refined my SQL skills but also provided me with valuable insights into customer behavior and data-driven decision-making. I welcome feedback and insights as I continue developing in the field of data analytics.
